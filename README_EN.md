# Hello, wanderer

## About me

I'm a 9th grade student, main hobby is anything related to the *IT* field, most interested in native programming (per se), engineering, and machine learning.

## How I started

I started my way in *IT* at the age of 6, when I first tried *Scratch* and *JS* a bit later, now for a bit more than *9 years* I've been constantly involved in programming, for a long time the main language was *Python* (I started it at the age of *10* and actively continued for about *3* years).

When I was *12.5* years old, I entered the Moscow School of Programmers (MSPS), I passed 1 year by external exam, and broke the school record in *Python* at the internal Olympiad. Then I started studying *C++* and I am still studying it. This year I graduated from MSPS, and all subjects in my certificate are *"A”*.

## Projects

Throughout my journey actively doing various projects, in the beginning it was simple games and attempts in 3D graphics and even my own language, now I am already doing my own *3D engine*, my own programming language and actively engaged in engineering (I know how to build a processor from transistors (*of course not in the most minute details, but at a significant level*)).
